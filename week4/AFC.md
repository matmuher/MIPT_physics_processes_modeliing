# AFC for harmonic driven oscillator

## General view

Here we see that  analytical AFC differs from simulated one. It's cause is that inital solution haven't faded out yet.

Let's increase time from which we start computing amplitude (so called steady time or decay time):

We see that increase of considered steady time leads to less error.
